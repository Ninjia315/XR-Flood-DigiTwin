# XR-Flood-DigiTwin

This is a system that visualizes the results of simulations of flooding conditions in rivers during floods and allows users to experience them in an AR/VR environment. This system will be used by the River Management Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan and flood control-related companies to formulate maintenance plans and provide explanations to local residents.

The system consists of two components: the Server and the Client device. The Server manages which content is to be visualized, while the Client displays AR and VR content using an iPad, iPhone, or Apple Vision Pro. The following video demonstrates these contents.
